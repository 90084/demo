Experimental UI for the bible soap opera project (http://biblesoapopera.com/)

To view the UI, go to http://biblesoapopera.github.com/demo.

Uses node.js and gulp to manage the build process.

Once built, only static files are served.

dev environment
===============

You will need node.js installed. Git is handy, but not required.

Download master, and install dependencies with npm.

Then run `node gulp.js`. This will compile to static files, start a dev server and live reload.

Then point your browser to `localhost`.
